                <h3>PhD studies</h2>
                <p class="just_justify">My PhD thesis working title is "Machine learning and communication of autonomous mobile robotic systems in collaborative multi-robot transportation".
                Currently, I am in the third and final year of PhD studies and working on writing an SCI journal paper.</p>
                <h3>MSc studies</h2>
                <p class="just_justify">In September 2019 I defended my master thesis titled "Stereo visual control of an intelligent mobile robot with distance detection of characteristic objects within a scene",
                finishing master studies with an average grade of 9.0 (max grade = 10.0).
                The most challenging part of master studies was numerous group projects with short deadlines that taught me value of teamwork and how to cooperate successfully with colleagues.
                </p>
                <h3>BSc studies</h2>
                <p class="just_justify">In September 2017 I defended my bachelor thesis titled "CNC programming of a two-axis lathe TCN410".
                During my bachelor studies, I was still searching for what interested me the most, and late in my studies, I found out the power and impact of programming.
                My bachelor thesis was not conventional programming but it made me realize how some arbitrary number lines of code can made machines do something extraordinary.
                From that point onwards I started tinkering with other programming languages and started to use them to my advantage during the following years of study.</p>
